        <p>Popcorn is a special kind of corn. Of all the types of corn, popcorn is the only variety that pops. Inside each kernel of popcorn is a tiny droplet of water surrounded by a hard shell called a hull. As the popcorn is heated, the water turns into steam, which builds pressure inside the kernel.</p>
        <p>Various studies have employed these techniques to derive a basic benchmark hourly rate for our non‐​work time. One study, for example, asked survey respondents in 2014 to provide the minimum amount of money they’d be willing to accept (or the maximum they were willing to pay) for trading 1 hour of paid work per week for 1 hour of unpaid work (e.g., household chores) or 1 hour of leisure time. The answer: about 16 euros (or $25.50/hour in 2022 dollars). A brand new study, meanwhile, used detailed GPS data on American drivers’ driving routes, gasoline refueling stops, and nearby station prices to document refueling patterns and determine how far off their normal routes drivers would be willing to drive to save money on gasoline (and thus how much drivers valued their time over cost savings). The result: “the median gas stop occurs within less than a one minute deviation from a driver’s shortest route, despite the possibility of saving an average of $0.09 per gallon within a two minute deviation.” Thus, drivers valued their travel time—“their observed willingness to travel further from their routes in order to pay a lower expected gasoline price”—at about $27.54/hour.</p>
        <p>You can’t re-create the first time you promise to love someone or the
            first time you feel loved by another. You cannot relive the sensation of fear,
            admiration, self-consciousness, passion, and desire all mixed into one
            because it never happens twice. You chase it like the first high for the rest
            of your life. It doesn’t mean you can’t love another or move on; it just
            means that the one spontaneous moment, the split second that you took
            the leap, when your heart was racing and your mind was muddled withWhat ifs?—that moment—will never happen the same way again. It will
            never feel as intense as the first time. At least, that’s the way I remember it.
            That’s why my mother always said we memorialize our past. Everything
            seems better in a memory.</p>
        <p>What is it that really makes us happy? As a psychologist and a meditation teacher in these chaotic and heartbreaking times, I am often asked this question. I find The Good Life, by Robert Waldinger, MD, and Marc Schultz, Ph.D., to be an excellent resource. This book draws on a research study of over 80 years, starting in 1938 with 724 participants. The study now includes 1,300 descendants of the original participants. It is the world’s longest scientific study of happiness. The authors wondered what measures would predict health and happiness. They originally thought that cholesterol or blood pressure would be important. It wasn’t. It turned out that satisfaction in relationships was the best predictor of a happy and healthy life.</p>
